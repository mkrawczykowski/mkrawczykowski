### ⚡ Surfer SEO-based tool to create better optimized contents
Surfer SEO is a tool for professional SEO experts that helps creating well optimized contents. It uses reverse engineering methodology: helps us to find out what phrases and words the highly ranked contents use so we can use the same phrases and words in our contents. You input a keyphrase you are interested in and Surfer SEO shows:
- what phrases to use
- how many of each of those phrases should we use in our content

### ⚡ Chess game
When I wanted to practice object-oriented programming in JS, I was looking for an idea for an app I could write. One day my brother was playing chess with our cousin and I thought: hey, it'd be a fun way to practice using objects! And hey - let's use Websocket too, to let two players play with eachother (I've never used Websocket before, but it seemed like an interesting piece of technology).<br><br>
Working on chess game really was fun, but a bit too difficult. Some elements already work (like generating of a chessboard or moving a piece), but I stopped working on it for now as the code is a bit too hard for me to add new fatures. I think I don't have enough experience yet to finish it.

### ⚡ Robot arm
When I first heard about Raspberry Pi, I thought 'Is it possible to control it with code written in Javascript? It turned out it is, so I decided to make first preparations to create a robot arm: writing some test code that would be used in a real device in the future.<br><br>
The idea is simple: I wanted to create a robot arm made up of two parts of equal length (to make calculations simpler; with two equal length arms we have kind of isosceles triangle), and arm's purpose was to be able to move its ending only on Y axis and not to move it on X axis. This requires the angles in triangle to be calculated in "real time" (every time a user changes the HTML range element). I don't know much about trygonometry, but The University of Wikipedia was here to help ;).
